# 📐 Applied Math and Physics 1

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or math enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to my **Applied Math and Physics 1** repository — a small archive from the **first semester (2022)** at **Howest DAE**.  

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **GeoGebra files** created during the course.  
They were used to explore **mathematical and physical principles** essential for understanding the **3D graphics pipeline** — from **trigonometry** and **vectors** to **matrices**, **transformations**, and **scene graphs**.

> ⚠️ Keep in mind: this repository contains **learning material only** — no executable builds are included.  
> The GeoGebra files are **difficult to interpret without the accompanying PDFs**, which cannot be shared here.  
> Think of this repo as a **visual notebook** of my early math explorations rather than a finished product.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This repository represents my **first structured exploration** of how mathematics connects to **graphics programming and real-time 3D**.  
It’s not perfect, but it’s the groundwork that made later shader and engine math click.  
As they say — *no vectors, no vertex transformations!* 🚀
